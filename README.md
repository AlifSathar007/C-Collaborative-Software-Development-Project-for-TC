This report documents the development of a software application designed to address a specific problem mentioned in the provided case study. The aim is to deliver a robust, functional, and a usable system that meets the user needs while providing to best practises in software engineering.
In this project, we formed a 4 student group to focus on understanding the current limitations on the existing system and creating a solution tailored to the problem at hand.  Through our careful analysis, we identified key requirements and implemented them. Our approach integrates software design principles, modern development tools, and a clear way to ensure a well-structured and maintainable application.
This report serves as a guide to the project, covering all aspects of our development, including problem definition, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance planning. Each section provides insights into the methods used, challenges faced, and the outcomes achieved, offering a clear picture of the project's scope and impact.
